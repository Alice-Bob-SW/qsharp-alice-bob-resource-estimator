//! Model for cat qubits.
//!
//! Cat qubits are characterized by:
//! - the physical error rate κ₁/κ₂
//! - their average number of photons |α|²
//!
//! Default value (and only one compatible with the magic state factories
//! precomputations) is κ₁/κ₂=1e-5, while |α|² is considered as an error
//! correction code parameter and not handled in this module (resource estimator
//! will optimized on it).

/// Struct for cat qubits, stores κ₁/κ₂, the ratio between the one and two
/// photon loss rates, as it defines the intrinsic physical error rate.
