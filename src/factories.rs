/// Struct containing parameters of Toffoli magic states factories based on
/// fault-tolerant measurement of stabilizers of the Toffoli magic state.
///
/// A factory is described by:
/// - the internal code distance (usually differs from the one of the main part
///   of the processor)
/// - average photon number |α|² inside the factory (also separate from the one
///   used in the rest of the processor)
/// - logical error probability
/// - acceptance probability (they are heralded)
/// - the number of steps it uses
///
/// Note that this code does not compute the performance (error and acceptance
/// probabilities, time, etc.) of the factories, but uses them. Hence it must be
/// precomputed outside of the resource estimator (that will only choose one of
/// the proposed factories).
